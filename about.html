      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Nova Narrative Studios is founded on the belief that games can do a lot more than entertain. Games have the power to inform, connect, and heal every single person. Our team is dedicated to creating meaningful gaming experiences that tackle real-world topics such as mental health, climate change, and cultural identity. Through compelling characters, thought-provoking plots, and immersive gameplay, we aim to open hearts and minds.</p>
<p>We are a diverse group of storytellers, developers, artists, and thinkers who collaborate with a shared purpose: to make games that matter. At Nova Narrative Studios, we value creativity, inclusivity, and emotional resonance. Every game we develop is a chance to explore complex themes and encourage empathy. We invite our players to engage with those ideas through interactive storytelling.</p>
